This is a screen capture of the Add Message dialog for Bots. This dialog has three buttons on the top of the card: Text, Actions, and Card (selected in this image). When the Cards tab is selected, the dialog has two tabs: General and Cards (selected in this image). Directly beneath the tabs are small tiles for each card created for the carousel. Each tile has a context menu and in this image, the first card bears a checkmark, meaning that it will display as the default choice in the preview.

Directly beneath are the input fields, which from top to bottom are Title, Description, Image URL, Actions, and Link.

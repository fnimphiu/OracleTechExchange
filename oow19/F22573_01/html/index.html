                  width="32">Before You Begin</h2>
              <p>This 60-minute hands-on lab introduces you to the Oracle
                Digital Assistant's Conversation Designer. This lab demonstrates
                how you can generate a fully functioning skill from example
                conversations between the user and the skill. </p>
              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>The ability to rapidly develop a functioning skill, one that
                typifies the interactions between the skill and its users, can
                be a very useful feature for any company developing a
                conversational interface for a number of reasons. These include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Getting the buy-in and sign-off from your business on the
                  flow and function of the skill.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Road testing the conversation flow with target users to get
                  their feedback.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Providing skill developers with a concrete idea of the
                  conversation that they need to implement.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>What Do You Need?</h3>
              <p>To complete this lab, you need an Oracle Digital Assistant
                (ODA) cloud instance. You can get one using either of the
                following approaches: </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="#trial">Setting up a trial instance</a>.
                  <p>By having your own instance, you can continue this lab
                    after the event and even build your own digital assistant.</p>
                </li>
                <li><a href="#shared-instance">Using a shared instance</a> that
                  has been provisioned for this event.
                  <p>If you select this option, you can dig into the lab with
                    less setup time.</p>
                  <p>This instance will be used by other participants in the
                    hands-on lab.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Get an Oracle Cloud Account</h4>
              <p>Before you can get a trial ODA instance, you need an Oracle
                Cloud account. If you don't already have one, go to <a href="https://oracle.com/oow19freetier"

                the Conversation Flow</h2>
              <p>You can conceptualize the user-skill conversation in different
                ways before you actually begin building it with the Conversation
                Designer. For example, you can sit down with a business
                stakeholder or target user and create a overall flow based on
                how they envision a typical conversation. For the purposes of
                this lab, we've already assembled the following flow for the
                conversation that you will realize using the Conversation
                Designer.</p>
              <figure><img src="img/conversation_mockup.png" alt="Description of this illustration"
                  width="100%"> <figcaption><a href="files/conversation_mockup.txt">Description
                    of the illustration</a></figcaption> </figure>
              <p>You'll notice that there are four top-level flows that can be
                triggered through natural language processing (NLP):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Live Chat -- Executed when the skill understands that user
                  wants to speak to an agent. It then hands the user off to a
                  call center. (For this lab, you won't actually be configuring
                  the agent hand off in Oracle Service Cloud. The goal here is
                  to just demonstrate the flow.)</li>
                <li>Buy Goods -- Presents a carousel of cards, each with a
                  different product. Each card directs the user to the company's
                  website.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Product Question -- Recognizes that the user wants to
                  ask a question about a product. It presents a list of help
                  topics, such as registering a warranty, checking a warranty,
                  or product support.</li>
                <li>Download User Manual -- Prompts the user for product
                  information and then presents the appropriate PDF that the
                  user can download.</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>

                Tasks</h2>
              <p>You need to create a new skill when you use the Conversation
                Designer (you can't use it with an existing skill), so start off
                by creating a new skill in your ODA instance. From your new
                skill, you'll access the Conversation Designer and then begin
                building the tasks.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>In your ODA instance, click the left menu (<img src="./img/left_nav_menu.png"
                    alt="The Menu Icon">), expand <strong>Development</strong>,
                  and then click <strong>Skills</strong>.</li>

                <img src="img/new_skill_tile.png" alt="The New Skill tile">
                <li> Complete the Create Skill dialog by giving your skill a
                  name. If you're sharing an instance with other developers,
                  start the name with your initials. For example:
                  GR_ConversationDesignerSkill.</li>

                <p> In this step, you're going to create a sample agent
                  escalation conversation, where the chat is transferred from
                  the skill to a live agent upon the user request. As mentioned
                  previously, you're not going to actually configure the agent
                  hand-off to Oracle Service Cloud. Instead, your going to add
                  the user request and a series of skill responses that would be
                  typical for an escalation scenario.</p>

                  <h3>Build the Buy Goods Task</h3>
                  <p>For this task, you're going to build a conversation where
                    the user searches for, and buys, a television. After you
                    enter the initial user request message, you're going to
                    create a series of skill messages that prompt the user
                    through the transaction. These messages include lists of
                    options, a confirmation message, and a carousel of cards
                    with images and clickable actions.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Click <strong>Buy Goods</strong> in the Tasks menu.</li>

                      Enter <i>I'd like to buy a television please</i>. Notice
                      that the Conversation Designer again classifies this type
                      of statement as an INTENT UTTERANCE.</li>

                      references an action whose value was defined already, the

                        for the action, it will enable the skill to populate the

                            style="color: #080000;">Be sure to enter the same

                            If you don't, the skill will output this message as

                  <p> For this conversation, the skill handles various product
                    support requests with a list of actions that route to other
                    tasks. To enable this routing, you will add actions that
                    branch to subtasks. As the name implies, subtasks perform
                    supporting functions. Unlike tasks, they contain
                    conversations that have been started by the skill, not by a

                    far, the user's responses have been the same as the default

                    default of <i>Up to 48 inch</i> and proceeds with <i>Up to
                      32 inch</i>. Why? Because the user's <i>Up to 32 inch</i>
                    message overrides the default setting in the preview mode.
                    If you hadn't added this user message, then the conversation
                    would play according to the default value. When you actually

                    each task. It has also added training data that it
                    interpolated from the task name and the user messages that
                    it classified as INTENT UTTERANCE.

                  <li>Enter any numeric string (like 9898989898989). Note that
                    the confirmation message references that value. If you
                    entered a string of letters (<i>wESdlfjlakdkl</i>, for
                    example), the skill would prompt you for a NUMBER entity
                    value.</li>
